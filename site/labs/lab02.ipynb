    "    \n",
    "    Although you can access this CS 101 server and the notebooks you have created online throughout the semester, you may want to keep a copy of your completed lab assignments so that you have a record for future reference.  In that case, you should select *File→Download as→* and either *IPython Notebook  (.ipynb)* or *HTML (.html)*.  You can save a copy wherever you like on the local file system.\n",
    "\n",

    "    IPython is an older name for Jupyter, and you may hear it occasionally used by your TA or other programmers.\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Another way is to feed your code line-by-line into a Python **interpreter**, which executes each line in turn and gives you the result of that piece of code.  This is an excellent way to explore data, for instance, or to test ideas once you are more familiar with Python. We are going to lauch a Python interpreter from a Linux system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A. Now open python interpreter in terminal with the following command line:    \n",
    "       <div style=\"background-color: #f7f7f9; border: 1px solid #e1e1e8;\"><code style=\"background-color: transparent;\">python\n",
    "</code></div>\n",
    "    B. Now you can try the python script lines from the python interpreter as you did earlier on the Python notebook server. For example, try the following:\n",
    "       <div style=\"background-color: #f7f7f9; border: 1px solid #e1e1e8;\"><code style=\"background-color: transparent;\">>>>print('hello world')\n",

    " >>>2 ** 64\n",

    " ...   print(counter)\n",
    " ...[press enter]\n",
    "</code></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "    C. To Exit Python and return to the terminal environment, press \"Ctrl + Z\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Finally, you can save a block of code as a **script**, which is like connecting a bunch of notebook cells together in one spot.  This is the most frequent way that Python is used, since it lets you run computations and data analyses without having to manually monitor your machine (like you do in a notebook).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For instance, we will consider a version of the countdown program you used above.  The code is basically identical, but instead of being in a notebook cell it is saved as a text file with the `.py` suffix.\n",
