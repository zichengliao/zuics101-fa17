  \begin{enumerate}
  \myitem  Most of the time, we want errors to happen---but we may not want our program to crash (stop executing)! \pause
  \myitem  We can tell Python to \texttt{try} a block of code, and it will run normally \texttt{except} if something goes wrong. \pause
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{Verbatim}
d = list( range( 10 ) )
i = 0
while i < len( d )+1:
    try:
        d[ i ] = d[ i ] ** 2.0
        i += 1

        print( 'An error occurred.' )

\begin{frame}[fragile]

  \begin{enumerate}
  \myitem  The advantage:  you can handle the error and execution can proceed normally.
  \myitem  The disadvantage:  the traceback doesn't appear automatically. \pause
  \myitem  This also doesn't guard against errors or bugs which don't raise an exception:
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{Verbatim}
d = list( range( 10 ) )
i = 0
while i < len( d )+1:
    try:
        d[ i ] = d[ i ] ** 2.0
        i += 1

  \begin{enumerate}
  \myitem  If we lose the information on what went wrong, our response may not be appropriate. \pause
  \myitem  What could have gone wrong in the code below?
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{Verbatim}
fname = 'spring.data'
try:
    data = open( fname,'r' )

    print( 'Unable to open file "%s".'%fname )

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Examples}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \myitem  It is often preferable to handle different kinds of errors separately:
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{Verbatim}
fname = 'spring.data'
try:
    data = open( fname,'r' )
except IOError as err:
    print( 'Unable to open file "%s" 
      with error "%s".'%(fname,err) )
finally:
    print( 'Done with file I/O code.' )
  \end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Examples}
  \Enlarge

  \begin{enumerate}
  \myitem  Finally, use \texttt{try} at the finest degree of precision you can:
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{Verbatim}
filename = 'spring.data'
try:
    data = open( filename,'r' )
except IOError as err:
    ...
  \end{Verbatim}

  is better than

  \begin{Verbatim}
filename = 'spring.data'
try:
    data = open( filename,'r' )
    for line in data:
        ...
except IOError as err:
    ...

  \begin{enumerate}
  \myitem  We don't like magic numbers, and we prefer not to hard-code values that can change.
  \myitem  It's also inconvenient to ask the user for input every time. \pause

		\myitem  A good approach:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\mysubitem  Create a 2D array for the state variables.
			\mysubitem  Each \emph{row} tracks a different simulation (angle).
			\mysubitem  Each \emph{column} tracks one time step.
