  A set of instructions executed by a computer to achieve a goal is called:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
  \item  a process
  \item  a program
  \item  a procedure
  \item  an algorithm
  \end{enumerate}

    \item A \emph{interpreted} language executes its program directly without pre-compilation of the entire code.  E.g., python, matlab
