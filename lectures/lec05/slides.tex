  \frametitle{Functions}
  \Enlarge

  \begin{itemize}
  \myitem  A small program (block of code) we can run within Python.
    \begin{itemize}
    \mysubitem  Saves us from rewriting code
    \mysubitem  Don't reinvent the wheel!
    \end{itemize}
  \myitem  Analogy:  Functions are more verbs.
  \myitem  Also called subroutine or procedure.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Function calls}
  \Enlarge

  \begin{itemize}
  \myitem  When we want to execute a function, we call or invoke it.
  \myitem  Use name of the function with parentheses.
    \begin{itemize}
    \mysubitem  \texttt{print()}
    \end{itemize}
  \myitem  Many functions come built-in to Python or in the standard library.
  \myitem  Others we will compose at need.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{User input}

  \begin{itemize}
  \myitem  \texttt{input} is a built-in function.
  \myitem  Argument:  string prompting user
  \myitem  Return value:  input from user (as \texttt{str})
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

"""
This is an extended comment.
